
Data Specifications

  From general considerations, the value read from the sensors should not be
the actual celsius value. The core temperature could be as low as 45, but
normally it is around 50. There is no sensible heat from the outlet of the fan
at that temperature range.

  After movie tests, the fan usually starts at 55, and getting to middle speed
around 60. It seems that the internal controller is better than thought to be.

  There should be more tests to go, and currently I should build the smart mode
a little higher than the default system. Start the fan around 60, middle speed
at 65, high speed around 70.
